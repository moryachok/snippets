The SSN Generator is designed to 
developers in need of randomly 
generated data for testing cases. 
The SSN validation 
validates the numbers 
pattern for a given 
state area code. 
Therefore, if a SSN 
passes this tool validation, it doesn't mean that it really exists, 
only that it's code, for the given pattern, is possible. 
This is the same validation that guarantees the basic authentication, 
of generated ssn's, for forms under development,

as they merely checks for a possible pattern. 
Generated SSN's aren't real, and shouldn't be 
used on attempt of any illegal activity.
